# Best-Videos
This program provides a semi-accurate ranking of the best videos of a channel or playlist, using: 
-	Views of the video
-	Upload date of the video

Its semi-accurate and not fully-accurate because a video that have been uploaded, for example
one minute ago, will have a high ranking obviously.

The program is extremely fast, I ranked 1495 videos in 60.1 seconds.

# Limit
You can analyze 500 000 videos per day (with default quota of 10 000 per day) for free using this program.

# Setup
- Navigate to folder in cmd then type:
     pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Just get a Youtube Data Api v3 developer key, it takes 5 minutes and it's free.
- To get a channel ID you can use this tool : https://www.streamweasels.com/tools/youtube-channel-id-and-user-id-convertor/
Or any tool that converts youtube username to a channel ID.
